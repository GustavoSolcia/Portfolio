# Portfolio
This portfolio repository contains some technical problems that I solved during my PhD and projects about topics that I find interesting.

* <a href="https://github.com/GustavoSolcia/Portfolio/tree/main/modified_NLM">Modified NLM</a>: The Non-Local Means (NLM) is a image filtering algorithm. In this project, I show how I changed the algorithm statistics from Gaussian to Ricianfor a special application in magnetic resonance images. The point of this project was to not "reinvent the wheel" and loose time in already developed complex code. Knowing how the algorithm works and how scikit-image is organized can do a significant impact with little work.
