# Portfolio
This portfolio repository contains some technical problems that I solved during my PhD and projects about topics that I find interesting.

* <a href="https://github.com/GustavoSolcia/Portfolio/tree/main/modified_NLM">Modified NLM</a>: The Non-Local Means (NLM) is a image filtering algorithm. In this project, I show how I changed the algorithm statistics from Gaussian to Ricianfor a special application in magnetic resonance images. The point of this project was to not "reinvent the wheel" and loose time in already developed complex code. Knowing how the algorithm works and how scikit-image is organized can do a significant impact with little work.

* <a href="https://github.com/GustavoSolcia/Portfolio/tree/main/BrukerMRIReconstruction">Bruker MRI Reconstruction</a>: A MRI reconstruction involves several image processing concepts. In this project, I show how I reorganized previous code from the lab and worked with a specific format from a preclinical MRI vendor. The reconstruction process depends on working with K-space, zero filling, Hanning filtering, and FFT.

* <a href="https://github.com/GustavoSolcia/Portfolio/tree/main/OpenFOAM_curtomBC">OpenFOAM Custom Boundary Condition</a>: With OpenFOAM you can create custom boundary conditions for your simulations. In this project, I created a parabolic velocity profile given by a flow rate that can be used in any cross-section shape. This was helpfull for simulations in complex geometries for some of my Ph.D. projects.
