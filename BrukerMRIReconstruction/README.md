# Bruker MRI Reconstruction

Bruker MRI raw data reconstruction from Paravision v5.1 of FLASH 3D images. This is a simplified version inspired on Bernd U. Foerster reconstruction (https://github.com/bfoe/BrukerOfflineReco). The reconstruction involves reading MRI raw complex data in k-space and the preparation with Bruker specifications, zero filling, and Hanning filter. 3D FFT is applied for calculation of magnitude and phase images.
